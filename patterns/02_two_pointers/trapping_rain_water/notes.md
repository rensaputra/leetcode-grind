# Trapping Rain Water

## Problem Statement

Given `n` non-negative integers representing an elevation map where the width of each bar is 1, compute how much water it can trap after raining.

## Example

```
Input: height = [0,1,0,2,1,0,1,3,2,1,2,1]
Output: 6
Explanation: The above elevation map (black section) is represented by array [0,1,0,2,1,0,1,3,2,1,2,1]. In this case, 6 units of rain water (blue section) are being trapped.
```

## Complexity Breakdown

Time: O(n). Every element is visited exactly once.
Space: O(1). Only using handlful of variables to keep track of the current state.
